I am a Ph.D. student in the [Astronomy department](https://das.uchile.cl/) at Universidad de Chile. I am interested in studying the Active Galactic Nuclei, explicitly understanding the mechanism behind the accretion disk. I am also interested in exploring the formation mechanism behind the Supermassive black hole binaries.
